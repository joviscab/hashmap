# Odin Project - HashMap Exercise

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This exercise is called HashMap and is part of the Javascript Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this exercise is to put to practice all the HashMap Data Structure knowledge that I have acquired until now.

## Skills

With this exercise my idea is to check the recursion skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.
